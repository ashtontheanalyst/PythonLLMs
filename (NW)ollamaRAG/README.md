## IMPORTANT:
- This is not working the way that I wanted it to so therefore I've gone a
different direction. I'm keeping this in though since it has functions
which may be useful later on.


## Notes:
- There must be a way to retrieve dat from wikipedia on different topics
and then convert it to like a PDF or JSON file. Might be good for this...
- https://www.gutenberg.org/ has tons of free books in PDF format which
can be good for testing our RAG LLM.


## Install/Setup:
1. Create and source into a venv
2. Download dependencies, `requirements.txt`
3. Download some sort of simple PDF file to work with for this example
